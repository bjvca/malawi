\begin_layout Abstract
It is often observed that smallholder farmers sell most of their marketable
 surplus immediately after the harvest when seasonal price movements reach
 their lowest point, instead of waiting just a few more months until prices
 recover.
 Most explanations for this apparently sub-optimal behavior focus on economic
 or infrastructural issues, such as credit constraints or lack of storage
 facilities.
 In this study, we zoom in on two potential behavioral explanations.
 One explanation is situated at the household expenditure side, and assumes
 that households face challenges in accurately predicting future expenditures,
 systematically underestimating future needs.
 A second potential explanation is situated at the household income side,
 where motivated reasoning leads farmers to sell too early and/or at low
 prices.
 To test these hypotheses, we conduct two planning based interventions among
 a sample of Malawian smallholder farmers: (1) a detailed expense budget
 and (2) a sales plan with explicit commitment to timing of sales, quantities
 and prices.
 The treatments were administered at harvest time in May 2022 and repeated
 at harvest time in April 2023.
 This report presents results from the first midline survey in the second
 season that was collected in September 2023/

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often observed that smallholder farmers sell most of their marketable
 surplus or cash crops immediately after the harvest to itinerant traders
 at the farm gate.
 Selling immediately after the harvest is not optimal: Thin and poorly integrate
d markets often mean that immediately post harvest prices in excess supply
 areas drop to their seasonal low.
 In addition to high supply immediately post harvest, agricultural commodities
 are often not yet in optimal condition.
 For instance, in the case of maize, fresh grains are generally not dry
 enough, requiring further processing and leading to increased risk of rot
 by the trader.
 Often, this is used by buyers as an additional reason to further drive
 down the price paid to the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over time, prices gradually recover, reaching their seasonal high just before
 the next harvest.
 At this time, many farmers have run out of stock, and need to turn to the
 market to buy back maize at prices that are often a multiple of what they
 received, a phenomenon known as the

 further show how farmers loose out twice, as transaction costs are passed
 on by traders to farmers when traders buy commodities from farmers in rural
 areas immediately after the harvest and store in warehouses in towns, but
 farmers also incur transaction costs when they have to go to town to buy
 back maize from the same traders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature suggest many possible reasons why farmers choose the sell
 early at low prices instead of waiting a few months until prices recover.
 Farmers may simply not have the space and infrastructure available to safely
 store large quantities of maize for extended periods of time

.
 It may be that traders only visit villages immediately after harvest, and
 farmers do not have the means to transport maize to markets themselves.
 Furthermore, issues related to social taxation may mean farmers convert
 maize to cash, which is easier to hide from friends and family

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the explanations above focus on neoclassical constraints to farmers'
 exploiting inter-temporal arbitrage.
 In this study, we zoom in on two potential behavioral explanations why
 farmers seemingly sell at sub-optimal timing.
 One potential explanation is situated at the household expenditure side,
 and assumes that households face challenges in accurately predicting future
 expenditures.
 In particular, farmers are constrained in their cognitive capacity leading
 them to underestimate future needs.
 Such

 leads farmer to sell more early on and save too little for later in the
 year 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A second potential explanation is situated at the household income side.
 Here the assumption is that

\end_inset

 behavior is caused by the fact that impatient farmers are prone to motivated
 reasoning, with farmers spending more than they should because they use
 reasoning to justify discretionary expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above hypotheses are tested with a field experiment among smallholder
 farmers in Malawi.
 These farmers produce (a mix of) maize, groundnuts and soybean from which
 at least part is destined for the market.
 Our experiment takes the form of a simple parallel design with two treatment
 arms and one control group.
 A first treatment arm tests for the role of budget neglect in explaining
 the sell low-buy high paradox: Farmers that are randomly assigned to the
 first treatment arm are taken through a detailed budgeting exercise immediately
 after harvest.
 In particular, in this intervention a trained enumerator sits with the
 household head and fills in a budget matrix of projected expenses for each
 month in the coming year.
 The second treatment arm uses commitment as a way to test the motivated
 reason hypothesis.
 Farmers that are randomly allocated to the second treatment arm receive
 a sales planning intervention.
 Here, a trained enumerator sits with the household head and plans how much
 they plan to sell of which crop in which month during in the coming year.
 For each planned sale, the household head is also asked to commit to a
 minimum price.
 Impact of the interventions on a variety of outcomes is compared against
 outcomes of a control group that did not get any intervention.

, and compares outcomes about 6 months post intervention of households in
 the treatment groups to outcomes of households in the control group.
 We find that, consistent with the theory, households in treatment groups
 remain with larges stocks of the maize and groundnuts.
 We also find that households in the treatment group were less likely to
 have bought soybean.
 In general, effects are stronger for the sales plan intervention than for
 the budgeting intervention.
 Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that households that received the sales
 plan intervention were more likely have sold groundnut, and sold larger
 quantities, in the first few months after the intervention.

In the next section, we provide a selective overview of related studies.
 We then outline the main research hypothesis we test, and describe the
 interventions used to do so.
 We then turn to the data with subsections that present descriptives for
 the study population and balance between treatment and control groups.
 We then turn to the midline data and report attrition and impact on primary
 and secondary outcomes.
 A last section concludes.

Why do farmers

\end_inset

? One of the most obvious neo-classical explanations is related to credit
 constraints.
 Using observational data,

 find that to meet consumption needs later in the year, many farmers end
 up buying back grain from the market a few months after selling it, effectively
 using the maize market as a high-interest lender of last resort.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/qje/qjy034"

\end_inset

 show that in a field experiment in Kenya, credit market imperfections limit
 farmersâ€™ abilities to move grain intertemporally.
 Providing timely access to credit allows farmers to buy at lower prices
 and sell at higher prices, increasing farm revenues and generating a return
 on investment of almost 30%.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dillon02102021"

\end_inset

 uses the fact that in Malawi, primary school began 3 months earlier in
 2010 than in 2009, and notes that this prompted households with children
 to sell maize when prices are particularly low.
 To identify the impacts of liquidity constraints during the lean season,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1257/aer.20180607"

\end_inset

 offered subsidized loans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia.
 They find that relaxing liquidity constraints not only changed marketing
 behavior, but also increased labor allocated to agricultural production
 (as opposed to day laboring as a coping strategy) and conclude that liquidity
 constraints thus contribute to inequality in rural economies in the longer
 run as well.
 While credit constraints thus seems to be an important reason why farmers
 sell immediately post harvest at low prices, we feel this is not the entire
 story.
 If farmers need urgent cash, it would make more sense to only sell part
 of the harvest to cover most urgent expenses, or to sell commodities that
 are less affected by price seasonality, like small livestock.
 However, farmers often seem to sell all of their marketable surplus immediately
 post harvest in a single transaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk averse farmers may also fail to delay sales if there is considerable
 uncertainty about the price in the future.
 A recent article by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ags:aaea20:304448"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 puzzle is not a puzzle at all.
 Using 20 years of data from 787 markets in 26 countries, they argue that
 in many cases the price increase seems insufficient and too uncertain for
 farmers to engage in inter-temporal arbitrage 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ags:aaea20:304448"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, their analysis use prices obtained from market centers, which
 may be a poor proxy for the farm-gate prices that farmers face: markets
 in main towns are generally much better integrated in the wider national,
 regional and even global economy, and so will be less prone to the extreme
 spikes and slumps that smallholder farmers in more remote areas experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third reason may be that farmers have nowhere to safely store crops, so
 they just sell.
 This could be a lack of space, as the average smallholder often harvest
 20-40 bags of 50kg of maize.
 But there are also risks related to pests and diseases affecting the stored
 maize.
 If lack of safe storage is the main reason why farmers do not engage in
 intertemporal arbitrage, then providing storage technology should delay
 sales.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 indeed find that households that received PICS bags, a type of hermetically
 sealed bag of two layers of polyethylene liners and a third layer made
 from woven polypropylene, stored maize for a longer period and reported
 a substantial drop in storage losses.
 Again, we feel storage is indeed part of the reason, but it does not explain
 everything.
 For instance, this explanation is at odds with the fact that the Agricultural
 Commodities Exchange (ACE) in Malawi consistently fails to fill its warehouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason may be related to social taxation.
 If a farmer has a lot of maize stored in his house, this is visible for
 family and neighbors, and it will be very hard to deny if neighbors come
 and ask for help during the hunger season.
 Therefore, farmers may choose to convert their harvest to money, which
 is easier to hide, even though this comes at a cost.
 Social taxation has been found important in a similar marketing decisions
 where household seem to forgo the benefits of buying in bulk

 study recurrent seasonal hunger in Zambia, which could be a direct consequence
 of suboptimal marketing behaviour, and conjecture that individuals tend
 to overestimate their available resources and consequently under-save.
 They test this hypothesis through an intervention that induces individuals
 to think through their budget set and formulate a spending plan.
 They find that treated households enter the hunger season with one additional
 month of savings, leading to a smoother spending profile over the year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research is also related to an established literature on lack of self-contro
l in cases where individuals have to make complex intertemporal decisions
 involving uncertain future events.
 If farmers are impatient and unsophisticated about this, nudges may be
 effective in reducing discretionary spending and increase investment in
 the future

Behavioural constraints to intertemporal arbitrage: Hypotheses and Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadly speaking, the behavioral foundation of the sell low-buy high behaviour
 is akin to the planning fallacy, where individuals typically underestimate
 the time it takes to complete a task, despite extensive experience with
 failure to complete the same task in a similar time frame in the past 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "buehler2010planning"

\end_inset

.
 The planning fallacy has different origins, including cognitive limitations
 and motivational factors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "buehler2010planning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first potential behavioral explanation for the sell low buy high puzzle
 that we will study is situated at the household expenditure side, and assumes
 that households face challenges in accurately predicting future expenditures.
 In particular, we assume that farmers systematically underestimate how
 much money they need in the future and as a result sell too much immediately
 after the harvest.
 For example, immediately after harvest, they may budget for fresh seed
 from the agro-input dealer and for fertilizer, but they may forget that
 they also need pesticides and insecticides.
 In general, predicting the full set of expenditures under all possible
 states of the world is likely to be beyond the cognitive capacity of human
 beings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "augenblick2021budget"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, farmers may underestimate the likelihood of, or simply forget
 to account for, unexpected events such illness within the family.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the first hypothesis, we designed an intervention that takes the
 farmer through a detailed budgeting exercise.
 In particular, the main decision maker within the household was provided
 with a template that needed to be filled as detailed as possible.
 Pre-populated expenditure categories included education expenditures (school
 fees, uniforms,...), agricultural investment expenditures (seed, fertilizer,...),
 investment expenditure in non-agricultural businesses (retail shop inventories,...
), health and medical expenses (medicines, preventive doctor visit,...), household
 recurrent expenditure (food, utilities,...), household equipment and maintenance
 (furniture, renovation,...), and other expenditures (loan repayment, ceremonies,...).
 For each of these expenditure item lines, farmers were then asked to provide
 an estimate of the total cost for each month between May 2022 and April
 2023 and write it down in the appropriate cell of the expenditure matrix.
 Farmers were also encouraged to provide their top 3 unexpected expenditures
 likely to occur between May 2022 and April 2023.
 We then calculate totals per month and also a grand total for the entire
 year.
 This first intervention will be referred to as treatment one (T1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second hypothesis is at the income side of the farm household and touches
 on the motivational origins of the planning fallacy.
 Immediately post harvest, farmers form expectations about how much they
 will get in the future from selling crops.
 If farmers are impatient and prone to motivated reasoning, the expected
 future revenue (and particularly the more stochastic elements such as the
 price) is a function of how much they will want to spend now.
 This may lead farmers to expect higher prices in the future to justify
 current discretionary spending.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if the sell low-buy high puzzle is predominantly cause by motivated
 reasoning, we develop, together with the farmer, a detailed sales plan
 for the year which is assumed to function as a commitment device closely
 modeled in the idea of mental accounting.
 Again using a template, we start by asking the farmer about the expected
 marketable surplus for maize, groundnuts and soybean.
 We then ask for each month between May 2022 and April 2023 how much the
 farmer is planning to sell for each of the crops, and what the minimum
 price and point in time should be before they sell.
 Also for the sales plan, we calculate totals per month and also a grand
 total for the entire year.
 This second intervention will be referred to as treatment two (T2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is a dynamic aspect to this, which we will use to differentiate
 motivated reasoning from alternative mechanisms.
 Over time, as the farmer draws down stocks, the motivated reasoning effect
 will become stronger: the farmer has to expect ever larger windfall gains
 in the future to justify additional discretionary spending.
 Our treatment reduces the motivated reasoning effect by confronting farmers
 with their expected prices at a time when the motivated reasoning effect
 was still weak.
 We thus expect that as the season progresses into the lean season, price
 expectations of untreated farmers will go up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did not merely ask farmers to create these expenditure and sales plans,
 but also encouraged them to hang them in a central place in the house or
 store them in a convenient location.
 Furthermore, to increase the likelihood that farmers use the plan, we also
 refer to the plan during midline surveys, and reiterate the importance
 of following these plans.

Right before endline data collection, it was decided to allow for (potential)
 follow-up in the longer run.
 This included re-treating some of the farmers.
 However, instead of simply repeating the treatment according to the original
 randomization, we also decided to include variation in treatment over time
 (year 1 versus year 2).
 In particular, we wanted to differentiate between farmers that were never
 treated ((CC)); farmers that were always treated ((T1T1) and (T2T2)); farmers
 that were treated only in the first year ((T1C) and (T2C)); and farmers
 that started receiving treatment in the second year ((CT1) and (CT2)).

In addition to measuring a dosage effect (once versus twice treated) the
 decision was also influence by the fact that we found significant imbalance

Data collection

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data collection took place around the end of May and beginning
 of June 2022.
 Using tablet computers and Open Data Kit software, 31 enumerators interviewed
 3534 farmers that were sampled from four districts in the Central and Northern
 Regions of Malawi (Kasungu, Ntchisi, Dowa and Mchinji).
 The study areas are characterized by rain-fed agriculture with a single
 agricultural season.

We selected farmers that produce maize, groundnuts and/or soybean.
 Maize is planted early in the year and harvest starts usually starts in
 April and proceeds through May.
 Soybean is harvested somewhat earlier, groundnuts somewhat later.
 Soybean and groundnuts can be sold pretty much immediately after the harvest;
 maize needs to be dried first.

To get a nationally representative sampling frame of the smallholder farmer
 population in Malawi, we rely on the list created by the Ministry of Agricultur
e for their Agricultural Input Programme (AIP).
 The AIP targets smallholder farmers in the villages who mostly registered
 with the village chiefs.
 We used a two-stage sampling procedure where we first sampled villages
 with the likelihood of a village being selected proportionate to the number
 of people that live in this village (such that larger villages are more
 likely to end up in the sample).
 We then randomly sampled 31 households in each of the sampled villages.

\begin_layout Standard
The focus of the study is on market participation and so the targeted study
 population consists of farmers that are likely to engage with markets.
 As such, we included qualifier questions in our survey, where we asked
 farmers if they were planning to sell maize, soybean or groundnuts during
 the 2022 and 2023 season.
 Restricting our study population to a particular sub-population has implication
s for the interpretation of the results.
 For instance, we will see later that we find relatively high proportions
 of households reporting to sell to the market.
 As such, the particular nature of the study population, semi-subsistence
 smallholder farmers, needs to be kept in mind when interpreting results,
 as they may be different from for example predominantly self-sufficient
 farmers.

Primary outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the most parsimonious specification by reporting simple difference
s between treatment and control farmers obtained from an Ordinary Least
 Squares regression that regresses the outcome of interest on two dummy
 variables indicating if the household received T1 or T2 respectively.
 Results are in the top panel of Table

.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Primary-maize"

 we show results after including additional controls.
 These include the outcome at baseline, and village fixed effects.
 We start with Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, which reports results for maize; Tables

 are similar tables but for groundnuts and soybean, respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
A first primary outcome we consider is stocks held of the commodity at the
 time of the midline survey.
 In particular, we asked farmers how many bags of the commodity (standard
 50 kg bags) they have in store.
 As the distributions are skewed to the right and includes zeros as well,
 we use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12325"

\end_inset

.
 For both treatments, we expect a positive effect.
 Similar to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "augenblick2021budget"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we expect that when making households aware about future needs, they will
 reduce discretionary expenditures and save more for the future.
 Furthermore, if farmers expect prices to go up over time and this is reflected
 in their sales plan, farmers that are encouraged to commit to this sales
 plan will also be more likely to have saved more early on in the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the average control farmer has about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_tc[1,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 bags of maize in store at the time of the survey.
 We do not find that this is significantly different in the sample of farmers
 that were taken through a budgeting exercise.
 However, we do find that stocks are significantly higher among farmers
 that made a sales plan.
 Farmers that were asked to commit to a sales plan have stocks that are
 about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sexpr{prim_maize_tc[1,7]*100}

 percent higher than maize stocks of farmers in the control group.
 If we add village fixed effects, the effect becomes even stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second primary outcome tests if the household sold any of the crop in
 the interval between the intervention and this midline survey.
 For similar reasons why we expect stocks to be higher, we expect that the
 treatment would reduce the likelihood of selling early on in the season.
 We find that 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_tc[3,1]*100}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households in the control group indicated that they made at
 least one sales transaction between in the first few months after the start
 of the project.
 We do not find that this proportion differs for farmers in T1 nor for farmers
 in T2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third primary outcome is related to the second and is the quantity that
 was sold during the period between the intervention and the first midline
 survey.
 While we may not find that the treatment reduced the fact that farmers
 sell early, we may still find that farmers sell less of the crop immediately
 after harvest.
 We find that farmers in the control group sell on average 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_tc[4,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 bags of maize.
 Contrary to our expectations, we see that these quantities are higher in
 both treatment groups, but the differences are not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For farmers that did engage in sales, we can calculate the average price
 that farmers received for their crop.
 The aim of the intervention is to increase the price at which farmers sell.
 The farmers that sold in the control group got on average 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_tc[6,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 MKW per kilogram of maize.
 We again do not find that prices differ significantly in any of the treatment
 groups.
 However, we expect that effects of the intervention will only become apparent
 at endline and prices over the entire period are taken into consideration.
 This is because the price effect is expected to come from more people selling
 later in the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also consider behaviour related to purchases of the commodities as key
 primary outcomes.
 We expect that, especially later in the season, due to our interventions
 households will have to buy back less.
 We see that in the control group, about 30 percent also made at least one
 purchase of maize before September midline data collection and this proportion
 is similar in both treatment groups.
 As for sales, we also look at quantities bought and prices at which the
 commodities were bought.
 We find that for maize, the average control group household bought less
 than one bag on average and paid slightly more than the sales price.
 We do not see any effects from the interventions.

, we repeat the entire analysis, but now for groundnuts.
 Households in the control group remain with less than 2 bags of groundnuts
 in stock.
 Also here, we see that households that drew up a sales plan (T2) have stocks
 that are about

 For groundnuts, we also see that stocks are significantly higher in the
 group that was asked to make a detailed expenditure plan (T1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A surprisingly larges share of households, over two thirds, indicate that
 they made at least one sales transaction between the intervention and the
 midline survey.
 However, it should also be noted that many households indicate that they
 did not cultivate groundnuts.
 Also surprising is that we find that households with a sales plan are more
 likely to have already soldâ€”

 Prices (here expressed in MKW per debe) do not appear to be different from
 the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for maize, we also asked if farmers that sold groundnuts also already
 bought groudnuts in the first few months post harvest.
 Only about 8 percent of farmers reported to have bought.
 We do not find an effect of the intervention on this outcome.
 Finally, we also do not find an impact on prices at which groundnuts were
 purchased, but as very few farmers bought groundnuts, sample size becomes
 too small to obtain reliable estimates.

 shows impact of the interventions on primary outcomes for soybean.
 We find that stocks for soybean at midline are somewhat higher in the group
 that received the sales plan treatment.
 T2 also seemed to have increased the likelihood that soy was already sold,
 as well as the quantity, but only if we control for village fixed effects.
 We also find significant effects for purchases: treated households were
 significantly less likely to already have bought soybean; average quantities
 bought are significantly lower for households that made a sales plan.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We use simulation to account for multiple comparisons.
 Simulation methods provide a flexible and intuitive way to think about
 multiple hypothesis testing.
 It accommodates the extent to which the multiple comparisons are correlated
 with one another and allows us to integrate design specific elements such
 as the blocking and multiple arms.
 This leads to a study-specific correction that will generally be more powerful
 than other methods to control the FWER.
 In particular, to determine target p-value cutoffs, we use the family-wise
 sharp null of no effect for any unit on any dependent variable and for
 any hypothesis.
 More information, including R code on which our tests are based can be
 found

Multiple comparison arise from the number of treatment arms, the different
 primary outcomes and the different crops included in the analysis.
 Equation XXX tests 2 hypotheses (we will not directly test T1 against T2),

 considers six outcomes, and look at 3 crops.
 This means a total of 36 hypothesis tests.
 Using a simple Bonferroni correction, this would mean that the 5 percent
 cut-off for the p-value would reduce to 0.001 and the 10 percent significance
 cutoff would reduce to 0.003.
 These values are only slightly higher on simulated data, but it is expected
 that with real data, correlation between outcomes is higher and difference
 between Bonferroni and the family wise null becomes larger.

\begin_layout Subsection
Secondary outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we look at some additional outcome which may be indirectly
 affected by the interventions.
 These outcomes may help explain some of the effect on primary outcomes,
 or they may be outcomes for which the expected effects are ambiguous.
 We again present separate tables for maize (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Secondary-maize"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), for groundnuts (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Secondary-gnuts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and for soybean (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Secondary-soy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first outcome we look at is the price in the near future.
 In particular, we asked all households what they expected the price would
 be around the end of the year.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Secondary-maize"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that farmers still expect a sizable price increase: while we saw
 in the previous section that the average farmer in the control group only
 got about 225 MKW per kilogram of maize during the first few months after
 harvest, the price is expected to increase to about 380 per kilogram around
 new year.
 Interestingly, we see that farmers who were taken through a budgeting exercise
 expect prices to be higher still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also wonder if our intervention would affect intra-household dynamics,
 in particular who is in charge of sales of the commodity.
 We see that in about 37 percent of households, the decisions related to
 the sales of maize is taken by the male and female co-head jointly, with
 both co-head having equal voice.
 We do not find that decision making is affected by the interventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another secondary outcome we consider is related to who was sold to.
 In particular, we test if, in response to our interventions, farmers increase
 the likelihood that they sell directly to the market, as this is often
 the place where they can get the best price for their crop 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.2307/3697909"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We find that very few farmers in our sample sell maize directly to the
 market, and that there are no difference between the different treatment
 groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we asked farmers that sold between the harvest and the midline
 survey what the proceeds from the transaction was used for.
 We examine the effect of our interventions on two categories.
 One expenditure type, payment of school fees, is likely to be predictable
 by the farmer.
 A second expenditure type, health related expenses, is probably less predictabl
e.
 We do not find that the treatment intervention changed the propensity that
 sales of maize were made for any of these expenses.

 for secondary outcomes of groundnuts, we see that farmers in the control
 group expect a further 60 percent increase of the price by the end of the
 year.
 Now, we see that farmers that were asked to provide a sales plan estimate
 that future prices will be lower than what control group farmers think,
 although just not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further find that decisions related to the sales of groundnuts are made
 jointly in slightly more households than was the case for maize.
 However, also here, there is no effect of the interventions.
 Groundnuts are rarely sold directly to the market, and there is also no
 effect of T1, nor T2.
 For the expense categories, we see that households that were asked to provide
 a detailed budget are more likely to have sold groundnuts to pay for school
 fees than farmers in the control group.

 shows results for secondary outcomes for soybean.
 Control group farmers estimate that prices will be almost double what they
 were during the first few months post harvest.
 As was the case for groundnuts, farmers that were assigned to the sales
 plan treatment (T2) provide slightly lower estimates for the price at the
 end of the year than farmers in the control group.

There is significantly less joint decision making when it comes to sales
 of soybean.
 However, also here, who makes decisions is not affected by the interventions.
 Results for who was sold to are similar to those for groundnuts.
 We also do not find any impact of the interventions on what happens with
 the proceeds from soybean sales.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we test two behavioral explanations for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sell low-buy high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 puzzle.
 The first explanation assumes that farmers underestimate how much money
 they will need later on in the season, leading them to sell too much immediatel
y post harvest at prices that are too low.
 We test this explanation through an intervention in which households are
 asked to prepare a detailed budget of what they will need for the entire
 year.
 It is expected that by making future expenditure more explicit, farmers
 will suffer less from budget neglect when making market participation decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second explanation assumes that farmers expect higher future returns
 to justify current consumption.
 To counter this dimension of the planning fallacy, we designed a light
 touch intervention where we ask farmers to prepare a detailed sales plan,
 indicating how much of each crop will be sold when during the coming year,
 and what the minimum price is they want for it, and hope this serves as
 a commitment device for the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We implemented our field experiment in a sample of about 3500 farmers in
 four districts in the Central and Northern Regions of Malawi.
 Treatments were administered during baseline data collection immediately
 after the maize harvest in April 2022.
 Results in this paper are based on a first (telephone based) midline survey,
 which was done in September 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find some evidence that households that were exposed to the interventions
 remain with higher stocks at the time of the midline survey.
 The effect on stocks is strongest for the treatment that involves drawing
 up a sales plan.
 We also find that for groundnuts, households that committed to a detailed
 plan on when to sell and at what price were more likely to have sold already
 during the first few months after the intervention, and sold larger quantities.
 Finally, we find some evidence that farmers that were exposed to the treatment
 were less likely to engage in buying soybean.
 For secondary outcomes, there is some evidence that farmers who are asked
 to draw up a sales plan expect more modest price increases than farmers
 in the control group, which is consistent with motivated reasoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the results are much more muted than the large increases in savings
 found immediately after implementing a similar budgeting intervention in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "augenblick2021budget"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in Zambia, we do think that results are encouraging.
 For instance, we find that for the crop that is harvested first (and so
 households are likely to start running out of stock earlier) households
 that were exposed to the treatment were less likely to have bought the
 crop.
 Furthermore, as this analysis is based on only a first midline survey done
 only three months after the intervention, we expect that many of the effects
 (such as the effect on sales prices and differences in sales and buy back
 patterns) will become stronger in future rounds of data collection.
