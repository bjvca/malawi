Market participation of smallholder farmers in Malawi: A baseline report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Smallholder farmers in low and middle income countries often sell the bulk
 of their marketable surplus immediately after the harvest, when prices
 are at their lowest.
 We pilot several interventions to investigate if this is due to poor planning.
 In one treatment arm we test if expenditure planning is a main determinant
 of sub-optimal marketing behaviour, while in a second treatment we look
 at planning on the income side and ask farmers to commit to timing and
 sales prices.
 In this report, we summarize the baseline data that was collected as part
 of this study.
 The study focuses on 3 three semi-commerical crops: maize, soybean and
 groundnuts.

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in developing countries generally produce for own consumptio
n.
 However, most farmers also need cash for a variety of non-food expenditures.
 Some farmers therefore produce more than what they expect they will need
 and sell a surplus.
 Other farmers cultivate cash crops.
 Therefore, most farmers are not strictly subsistence farmers, but also
 participate in the market, not only as consumers, but also as producers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When farmers interact with markets, they are also exposed to price risk.
 In weakly integrated markets where spatial arbitrage is slow and transaction
 costs to move commodities from low price regions to high price areas are
 high, prices often exhibit significant variation both in time and space
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "van2007modelling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This generally also means that prices exhibit significant seasonality,
 with price at their lowest immediately after harvest as supply booms, and
 prices then gradually increasing until reaching a peak just before the
 next harvest

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These predictable and recurrent price movements suggests that farmers have
 an incentive to delay sales of at least part of their marketable surplus
 until prices recover from their post harvest slump.
 In practice, however, we often see that farmers sell all of their crop
 immediately after harvest when prices are at their lowest.
 Often, later in the season, farmers run out of stocks and are forced to
 turn to the market again, now buying back the same commodities at much
 higher prices.
 This has sometimes been referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 phenomenon

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various reasons have been suggested to explain this behaviour.
 The most obvious reason would be that farmers simply need the money.
 For instance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/qje/qjy034"

\end_inset

 report on a field experiment in Kenya and suggest that credit market imperfecti
ons limit farmersâ€™ abilities to move grain intertemporally.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 uses the fact that in Malawi, primary school began 3 months earlier in
 2010 than in 2009, and notes that this prompted households with children
 to sell maize when prices are particularly low.
 To identify the impacts of liquidity during the lean season, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/aer.20180607"

\end_inset

 offered subsidized loans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia
 and conclude that liquidity constraints contribute to inequality in rural
 economies.
 Another often heard reason is that farmers may simply lack sufficient safe
 storage space for their crops, making it too expensive to store for longer
 periods of time.
 If storage is the main reason why farmers do not engage in intertemporal
 arbitrage, then providing storage technology should delay sales.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 indeed find that Ugandan maize farmers that received a low cost, simple,
 and effective technology for low resource farmers to help them preserve
 their dry crops after harvest with minimal losses due to storage insects
 (so called PICS bags) stored maize for a longer period.
 However, in a study comparing the importance of liquidity constraints and
 storage limitations, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "CHANNA2022102851"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 finds that only the former contains farmers from selling later at higher
 prices in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above factors will be binding for some farmers, many questions
 remain unanswered.
 For example, if liquidity constraints are the main problem, it is unclear
 why farmers generally sell everything at once, instead of just enough to
 cover the most urgent expenses.
 If storage is a problem, it seems strange strange that not more farmers
 form groups to rent storage space, or why in Malawi the Agricultural Commodity
 Exchange faces difficulties filling their warehouses.

, we test two behavioural explanations related to the inability of farmers
 to if this is due to poor planning.
 In one treatment arm we test if expenditure planning is a main determinant
 of sub-optimal marketing behaviour, while in a second treatment we look
 at planning on the income side and ask farmers to commit to timing and
 sales prices.
 In this report, we summarize the baseline data that was collected as part

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data collection took place between around the end of May and beginning of
 June 2022.
 Using tablet computers and Open Data Kit software, 31 enumerators interviewed
 3534 farmers that were sampled from four districts in the Central and Northern
 Regions of Malawi (Kasungu, Ntchisi, Dowa and Mchinji).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get a nationally representative sampling frame of the smallholders farmers
 population Malawi, we rely on the list created by the Ministry of Agriculture
 for their Agricultural Input Programme (AIP).
 The AIP only targets smallholder farmers in the villages who mostly registered
 with the village chiefs.
 We used a two-stage sampling procedure where we first sampled villages
 with the likelihood of a village being selected being proportionate to
 the number of people that live in this village (such that larger villages
 are more likely to end up in the sample).
 We then randomly sampled 31 households in each of the sampled villages.

The focus of the study is on market participation and so the targeted study
 population are farmers that are likely to engage with markets.
 As such, we included qualifier questions in our sample, where we asked
 farmers if they were planning to sell maize, soybean or groundnuts during
 the 2022 season.
 Restricting our study population to a particular sub-population has implication
s for the interpretation of the results.
 For instance, we will see later that we find relatively high proportions
 of households reporting to sell to the market as compared to what is typically
 found in other studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barrett2010smallholder"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As such, the study population, semi-subsistence smallholder farmers, needs
 to be kept in mind when interpreting results, as they may be different
 from for example pure subsistence farmers.

 presents the summary statistics of the households and household heads that
 we surveyed.
 Eighty percent (80%) of the households are headed by men.
 The average household is headed by a 43 year old with six years of schooling
 (primary level).
 The typical household has five members on average, living in houses of
 three rooms.
 Four in every 10 households have their main houses roofed with corrugated
 iron sheets.
 We find that the average distance of the households to the nearest all
 weather road and nearest market is 1km and 4km respectively.
\end_layout

We also collected information on the households' access to transport facilities
 or assets (either through ownership or hire).
 Results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 show that households mostly have access to a bicycle (72% of respondents)
 and ox-carts (60% of the respondents).
 Ox-carts are particularly important for transportation of harvest from
 the farms to the market.
 Households also own livestock assets; the most common being chicken, goats
 and pigs.

As part of baseline data collection, we asked questions about price expectations
 in the coming year.
 In particular, we asked what price they expect a farmer to receive for
 selling maize at the market nearest here, in early September of 2022 (the
 beginning of the school year).
 This was asked for maize, soybean and for groundnuts in appropriate units
 (kg for maize and soybean, debbe for groundnuts).
 We repeated this question, but for late December of 2022 (at the new year).

 shows price expectations for the three crops included in the study (here
 expressed per kg of the crop).
 As can be seen, farmers expect that prices increase over time.
 The increase of the expected price over the course of only a few months
 is substantial.
 For example, for maize, the increase in median price is

 of a goat increased substantially over time.

 at that time.
 We also asked what they expect to pay for hiring labour to prepare 1 acres

The graph shows that in quantities, maize is a very important commodity.
 However, the value-to-weight ratio of these crops differs substantially,
 and so to get a different perspective of the importance of the three crops,
 we multiply quantities with prices to get an idea of the value of production.
 To do so, we simply multiply quantities with the average price of the crop
 received in 2021.
 Results are in the bottom panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We see that groundnuts become more important, while the share contributed
 by soy bean becomes smaller.
 Note that the value of harvest is a rather theoretical concept.
 Actual income of the household will depend on how much of this is sold,
 and especially, when it was sold given potentially large seasonality in
 prices.
 The next sections look into these aspects of smallholder farmer behaviour.

We also collected information on production in 2022.
 As the survey took place around the end of May, maize and especially groundnuts
 were often still in the field.
 However, we also asked farmers to give an estimate of what they expect
 to get from fields that still needed to be harvested.
 Aggregating over all households in our sample, we find total production
 to be about 310 tons of groundnuts, 770 tons of soy and 4000 tons of maize.

The figure reflects the fact that rains started late in 2022, and so most
 of the maize and groundnuts still needed to be harvested in June.
 Soy sells currently at more than 600 kwatcha per kg, which is reflected
 in a much larger important in total value.
 However, also groundnuts and maize prizes are multiples of last year, resulting
 in much larger overall values.

 But there are also signs of sub-optimal sales behaviour.

 it seems farmers often sell everything in one go: of all the farmers that

 We also see large shares of households that report selling a paricular

 We have defined early here as withing three months from the harvest date
 of the crop.
 We find that 45 percent of households report at least one maize sale transactio
n with the first three months post harvest (when prices are generally still
 low - see below).
 Postponing sales to get a higher price seems to be even less common for
 soybean.
 Here, again 8 out of 10 households reported at least on transaction with
 three months from harvest.

We now investigate the relationship between price expectations and prices
 received in the past.
 We first relate the average price that the farmer received in the previous
 season to price expectations in the next season using OLS models.
 To enable comparisons across crops, we use natural logarithms of both expected
 prices and prices received in the past, such that results can be interpreted
 as elasticities.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Correlation-with-average"

caps "false"

\end_inset

 starts by correlating overall price expectations (defined as simple average
 over expected price in September and December) to the average price that
 the farmer reported to have received over the preceding season.
 We see that there is a significant correlation between prices received
 in the past and price expectations for maize and for groundnuts, but not
 for soybean.
 For example the first column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Correlation-with-average"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that farmers that sold at double the price (100 percent) than other
 farmers report expected prices that are about 10 percent higher than what
 other farmers expect.
 The second column shows that the elasticity is almost double for groundnuts.
 We do not find that price expectations for soybean are significantly correlated
 with average price expectations in the next season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table also shows correlation at prices at particular points in time
 in the future (instead of simple averages).
 For maize, the relationship between past prices and expected prices seems
 stable over time: farmers that received higher prices in the past expect
 higher prices in both September and December and the elasticity is the
 same.
 For groundnuts, a change in the average price received in the previous
 season is correlated to a larger price increase in the expected price in
 September than in December.
 The independence of price expectations and past prices of soybean is confirmed.

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of simply averaging prices received in the previous season, we can
 also look at price dynamics in the previous season to better understand
 the formation of expectations.
 For instance, we can check if expectations of the price evolution in the
 next season of farmers that experienced a sharp increase in prices they
 received for their crops in the previous season differ from expectations
 of farmers that experienced relatively stable prices throughout the previous
 season.
 To answer this question, we can exploit the fact that some farmers sold
 more than once in the previous season and relate changes in past prices
 to changes in expected future prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each transaction in the previous season, we recorded price obtained
 and the month in which the transaction took place.
 To facilitate analysis, we categorize transactions into three periods.
 First, transactions in May, June or July 2021 are categorizes as early
 sales.
 Transactions in August, September and October are referred to as average
 sales.
 And finally, sales made in November, December and January are grouped into
 the third category and are referred to as late sales.
 We calculate average prices obtained during transactions within each of
 these three periods at the farmer level and then estimate the following
 first-differences models:

.
 In the first column, we pool all crops, while the remaining three columns
 provide results for separate regressions for each crop.
 In the first row, the change in prices received is based on average prices
 in August, September and October and average prices received in November,
 December and January.
 This roughly corresponds to the difference in timing used for the dependent
 variables (change between September and December).The second row uses the
 same dependent variable but relates it to prices received early in the
 season of 2021 and prices received late in the season.
 The last row relates changes in expected prices to changes between prices
 early in the season and mid season.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers often sell within the first three months post harvest and sell the
 entire marketable surplus in one single transaction.
 This seems to be especially the case for soy bean, which is generally cultivate
d as a cash crop.
 Ironically, prices of soybean have more than doubled, but the largest price
 increase happened only from November onward, when most of the soybean farmers
 had already sold their marketable surplus.
 Provided that price movements of soybean follow a similar pattern in the
 future, soybean farmers can substantially increase their revenue by waiting
 longer before selling, or selling smaller qualities at different points
 in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that prices farmers that received higher prices in the previous
 season also expect higher prices in the next season.
 This is especially the case for groundnuts; for soybean, prices in the
 past are not correlated to prices in the future.
 Furthermore, we find that farmers that experienced a larger increase in
 prices over the previous season also expect prices to rise faster.
 This is especially the case if farmers experienced a price increase early
 in the season.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that prices received in the past are positively correlated to price
 expectations.
 If farmers are myopic about inflation, this will mean price expectations
 are biased downward.
 With average inflation at around 16 percent, it is likely that farmers
 prone to anchoring leave substantial amounts of money on the table.
