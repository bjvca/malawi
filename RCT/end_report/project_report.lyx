 the Sell Low-Buy High Puzzle in Smallholder Market Participation

\begin_layout Abstract
It is often observed that smallholder farmers sell most of their marketable
 surplus immediately after the harvest when seasonal price movements reach
 their lowest point, instead of waiting just a few more months until prices
 recover.
 Most explanations for this apparently sub-optimal behavior focus on economic
 or infrastructural issues, such as credit constraints or lack of storage
 facilities.
 In this study, we zoom in on two potential behavioral explanations.
 One explanation is situated at the household expenditure side, and assumes
 that households face challenges in accurately predicting future expenditures,
 systematically underestimating future needs.
 A second potential explanation is situated at the household income side,
 where motivated reasoning leads farmers to sell too early and/or at low
 prices.
 To test these hypotheses, we conduct two planning based interventions among
 a sample of Malawian smallholder farmers: (1) a detailed expense budget
 and (2) a sales plan with explicit commitment to timing of sales, quantities
 and prices.
 The treatments were administered at harvest time in May 2022 and repeated
 at harvest time in April 2023.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often observed that smallholder farmers sell most of their marketable
 surplus or cash crops immediately after the harvest to itinerant traders
 at the farm gate.
 Selling immediately after the harvest is not optimal: Thin and poorly integrate
d markets often mean that immediately post harvest prices in excess supply
 areas drop to their seasonal low.
 In addition to high supply immediately post harvest, agricultural commodities
 are often not yet in optimal condition.
 For instance, in the case of maize, fresh grains are generally not dry
 enough, requiring further processing and leading to increased risk of rot
 by the trader.
 Often, this is used by buyers as an additional reason to further drive
 down the price paid to the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over time, prices gradually recover, reaching their seasonal high just before
 the next harvest.
 At this time, many farmers have run out of stock, and need to turn to the
 market to buy back maize at prices that are often a multiple of what they
 received, a phenomenon known as the

 further show how farmers loose out twice, as transaction costs are passed
 on by traders to farmers when traders buy commodities from farmers in rural
 areas immediately after the harvest and store in warehouses in towns, but
 farmers also incur transaction costs when they have to go to town to buy
 back maize from the same traders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature suggest many possible reasons why farmers choose the sell
 early at low prices instead of waiting a few months until prices recover.
 Farmers may simply not have the space and infrastructure available to safely
 store large quantities of maize for extended periods of time

 It may be that traders only visit villages immediately after harvest, and
 farmers do not have the means to transport maize to markets themselves.
 Furthermore, issues related to social taxation may mean farmers convert
 maize to cash, which is easier to hide from friends and family

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the explanations above focus on neoclassical constraints to farmers'
 exploiting inter-temporal arbitrage.
 In this study, we zoom in on two potential behavioral explanations why
 farmers seemingly sell at sub-optimal timing.
 One potential explanation is situated at the household expenditure side,
 and assumes that households face challenges in accurately predicting future
 expenditures.
 In particular, farmers are constrained in their cognitive capacity leading
 them to underestimate future needs.
 Such

 leads farmer to sell more early on and save too little for later in the
 year 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A second potential explanation is situated at the household income side.
 Here the assumption is that

\end_inset

 behavior is caused by the fact that impatient farmers are prone to motivated
 reasoning, with farmers spending more than they should because they use
 reasoning to justify discretionary expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above hypotheses are tested with a field experiment among smallholder
 farmers in Malawi.
 These farmers produce (a mix of) maize, groundnuts and soybean from which
 at least part is destined for the market.
 Our experiment takes the form of a simple parallel design with two treatment
 arms and one control group.
 A first treatment arm tests for the role of budget neglect in explaining
 the sell low-buy high paradox: Farmers that are randomly assigned to the
 first treatment arm are taken through a detailed budgeting exercise immediately
 after harvest.
 In particular, in this intervention a trained enumerator sits with the
 household head and fills in a budget matrix of projected expenses for each
 month in the coming year.
 The second treatment arm uses commitment as a way to test the motivated
 reason hypothesis.
 Farmers that are randomly allocated to the second treatment arm receive
 a sales planning intervention.
 Here, a trained enumerator sits with the household head and plans how much
 they plan to sell of which crop in which month during in the coming year.
 For each planned sale, the household head is also asked to commit to a
 minimum price.
 Impact of the interventions on a variety of outcomes is compared against
 outcomes of a control group that did not get any intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also decided to repeat the treatment after one season allowing us to
 test if repeated treatments are more effective than one off treatments.
 As such, in the second year we have seven parallel treatment arms.
 Farmers that were in the control group in both years, farmers that received
 a treatment in the first year (either the first or the second) but not
 in the second year, farmers that received the treatment only in the second
 year (either the first or the second), and those the received the treatment
 in both years (the same treatment was administered in both years; we do
 not switch treatments).

 seasons during which this project was implemented.

Why do farmers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sell low and buy high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? One of the most obvious neo-classical explanations is related to credit
 constraints.
 Using observational data,

\end_inset

 find that to meet consumption needs later in the year, many farmers end
 up buying back grain from the market a few months after selling it, effectively
 using the maize market as a high-interest lender of last resort.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/qje/qjy034"

\end_inset

 show that in a field experiment in Kenya, credit market imperfections limit
 farmers’ abilities to move grain intertemporally.
 Providing timely access to credit allows farmers to buy at lower prices
 and sell at higher prices, increasing farm revenues and generating a return
 on investment of almost 30%.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dillon02102021"

\end_inset

 uses the fact that in Malawi, primary school began 3 months earlier in
 2010 than in 2009, and notes that this prompted households with children
 to sell maize when prices are particularly low.
 To identify the impacts of liquidity constraints during the lean season,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1257/aer.20180607"

\end_inset

 offered subsidized loans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia.
 They find that relaxing liquidity constraints not only changed marketing
 behavior, but also increased labor allocated to agricultural production
 (as opposed to day laboring as a coping strategy) and conclude that liquidity
 constraints thus contribute to inequality in rural economies in the longer
 run as well.
 While credit constraints thus seems to be an important reason why farmers
 sell immediately post harvest at low prices, we feel this is not the entire
 story.
 If farmers need urgent cash, it would make more sense to only sell part
 of the harvest to cover most urgent expenses, or to sell commodities that
 are less affected by price seasonality, like small livestock.
 However, farmers often seem to sell all of their marketable surplus immediately
 post harvest in a single transaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk averse farmers may also fail to delay sales if there is considerable
 uncertainty about the price in the future.
 A recent article by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ags:aaea20:304448"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 puzzle is not a puzzle at all.
 Using 20 years of data from 787 markets in 26 countries, they argue that
 in many cases the price increase seems insufficient and too uncertain for
 farmers to engage in inter-temporal arbitrage 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ags:aaea20:304448"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, their analysis use prices obtained from market centers, which
 may be a poor proxy for the farm-gate prices that farmers face: markets
 in main towns are generally much better integrated in the wider national,
 regional and even global economy, and so will be less prone to the extreme
 spikes and slumps that smallholder farmers in more remote areas experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third reason may be that farmers have nowhere to safely store crops, so
 they just sell.
 This could be a lack of space, as the average smallholder often harvest
 20-40 bags of 50kg of maize.
 But there are also risks related to pests and diseases affecting the stored
 maize.
 If lack of safe storage is the main reason why farmers do not engage in
 intertemporal arbitrage, then providing storage technology should delay
 sales.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 indeed find that households that received PICS bags, a type of hermetically
 sealed bag of two layers of polyethylene liners and a third layer made
 from woven polypropylene, stored maize for a longer period and reported
 a substantial drop in storage losses.
 Again, we feel storage is indeed part of the reason, but it does not explain
 everything.
 For instance, this explanation is at odds with the fact that the Agricultural
 Commodities Exchange (ACE) in Malawi consistently fails to fill its warehouses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason may be related to social taxation.
 If a farmer has a lot of maize stored in his house, this is visible for
 family and neighbors, and it will be very hard to deny if neighbors come
 and ask for help during the hunger season.
 Therefore, farmers may choose to convert their harvest to money, which
 is easier to hide, even though this comes at a cost.
 Social taxation has been found important in a similar marketing decisions
 where household seem to forgo the benefits of buying in bulk

 study recurrent seasonal hunger in Zambia, which could be a direct consequence
 of suboptimal marketing behaviour, and conjecture that individuals tend
 to overestimate their available resources and consequently under-save.
 They test this hypothesis through an intervention that induces individuals
 to think through their budget set and formulate a spending plan.
 They find that treated households enter the hunger season with one additional
 month of savings, leading to a smoother spending profile over the year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research is also related to an established literature on lack of self-contro
l in cases where individuals have to make complex intertemporal decisions
 involving uncertain future events.
 If farmers are impatient and unsophisticated about this, nudges may be
 effective in reducing discretionary spending and increase investment in
 the future

Behavioural constraints to intertemporal arbitrage: Hypotheses and Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadly speaking, the behavioral foundation of the sell low-buy high behaviour
 is akin to the planning fallacy, where individuals typically underestimate
 the time it takes to complete a task, despite extensive experience with
 failure to complete the same task in a similar time frame in the past 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "buehler2010planning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The planning fallacy has different origins, including cognitive limitations
 and motivational factors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "buehler2010planning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first potential behavioral explanation for the sell low buy high puzzle
 that we will study is situated at the household expenditure side, and assumes
 that households face challenges in accurately predicting future expenditures.
 In particular, we assume that farmers systematically underestimate how
 much money they need in the future and as a result sell too much immediately
 after the harvest.
 For example, immediately after harvest, they may budget for fresh seed
 from the agro-input dealer and for fertilizer, but they may forget that
 they also need pesticides and insecticides.
 In general, predicting the full set of expenditures under all possible
 states of the world is likely to be beyond the cognitive capacity of human
 beings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "augenblick2021budget"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, farmers may underestimate the likelihood of, or simply forget
 to account for, unexpected events such illness within the family.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the first hypothesis, we designed an intervention that takes the
 farmer through a detailed budgeting exercise.
 In particular, the main decision maker within the household was provided
 with a template that needed to be filled as detailed as possible.
 Pre-populated expenditure categories included education expenditures (school
 fees, uniforms,...), agricultural investment expenditures (seed, fertilizer,...),
 investment expenditure in non-agricultural businesses (retail shop inventories,...
), health and medical expenses (medicines, preventive doctor visit,...), household
 recurrent expenditure (food, utilities,...), household equipment and maintenance
 (furniture, renovation,...), and other expenditures (loan repayment, ceremonies,...).
 For each of these expenditure item lines, farmers were then asked to provide
 an estimate of the total cost for each month between May 2022 and April
 2023 and write it down in the appropriate cell of the expenditure matrix.
 Farmers were also encouraged to provide their top 3 unexpected expenditures
 likely to occur between May 2022 and April 2023 (and between May 2023 and
 April 2024 for the second season).
 We then calculate totals per month and also a grand total for the entire
 year.
 This first intervention will be referred to as treatment one (T1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second hypothesis is at the income side of the farm household and touches
 on the motivational origins of the planning fallacy.
 Immediately post harvest, farmers form expectations about how much they
 will get in the future from selling crops.
 If farmers are impatient and prone to motivated reasoning, the expected
 future revenue (and particularly the more stochastic elements such as the
 price) is a function of how much they will want to spend now.
 This may lead farmers to expect higher prices in the future to justify
 current discretionary spending.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if the sell low-buy high puzzle is predominantly cause by motivated
 reasoning, we develop, together with the farmer, a detailed sales plan
 for the year which is assumed to function as a commitment device closely
 modeled in the idea of mental accounting.
 Again using a template, we start by asking the farmer about the expected
 marketable surplus for maize, groundnuts and soybean.
 We then ask for each month between May 2022 and April 2023 (and between
 May 2023 and April 2024 for the second season) how much the farmer is planning
 to sell for each of the crops, and what the minimum price and point in
 time should be before they sell.
 Also for the sales plan, we calculate totals per month and also a grand
 total for the entire year.
 This second intervention will be referred to as treatment two (T2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is a dynamic aspect to this, which we will use to differentiate
 motivated reasoning from alternative mechanisms.
 Over time, as the farmer draws down stocks, the motivated reasoning effect
 will become stronger: the farmer has to expect ever larger windfall gains
 in the future to justify additional discretionary spending.
 Our treatment reduces the motivated reasoning effect by confronting farmers
 with their expected prices at a time when the motivated reasoning effect
 was still weak.
 We thus expect that as the season progresses into the lean season, price
 expectations of untreated farmers will go up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did not merely ask farmers to create these expenditure and sales plans,
 but also encouraged them to hang them in a central place in the house or
 store them in a convenient location.
 Furthermore, to increase the likelihood that farmers use the plan, we also
 refer to the plan during midline surveys, and reiterate the importance
 of following these plans.
\end_layout

Experimental design and specifications

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was initially designed as a parallel design with one common

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that, in a similar budget neglect experiment, treated farmers enter
 the hungry season with 20 percent more maize (valued by current prices
 at 405 zambian kwacha instead of 335 zambian kwacha in the control group).
 If we assume that standard deviation is about 592 (1.6 times the mean of
 treatment and control means – the 1.6 is derived from maize production data
 in Uganda), we get a sample size of 1,123 in each treatment arm.
 For one control group and two treatment arms we will thus need about 3,400
 farmers.
 For logistical reasons, we will applied cluster sampling in villages and
 randomly selected 31 farmers per village.
 As power is optimal when one allocates approximately 42% of the sample
 to control, and then equally (29% each) to each treatment arm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, chose 13 households for the control and 9 households in each of the two
 treatment groups per village.
 This means we included about 110 villages in our study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right before the April 2023 survey round (which was supposed to be the last
 round), it was decided to allow for follow-up in the subsequent season.
 As such, we re-treated some of the farmers.
 However, instead of simply repeating the treatment according to the original
 randomization, we also decided to include variation in treatment over time
 (year 1 versus year 2).
 In particular, we wanted to differentiate between farmers that were never
 treated ((CC)); farmers that were always treated ((T1T1) and (T2T2)); farmers
 that were treated only in the first year ((T1C) and (T2C)); and farmers
 that started receiving treatment in the second year ((CT1) and (CT2)).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In addition to measuring a dosage effect (once versus twice treated) the
 decision was also influence by the fact that we found significant imbalance
 on a range of baseline characteristics for the second treatment.
 We hope that concerns related to this imbalance can be addressed by comparing
 differences between C and T2 in year one to differences in year 2 (comparing
 CC and CT2).

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data collection took place around the end of May and beginning
 of June 2022.
 Using tablet computers and Open Data Kit software, 31 enumerators interviewed
 3534 farmers that were sampled from four districts in the Central and Northern
 Regions of Malawi (Kasungu, Ntchisi, Dowa and Mchinji).
 The study areas are characterized by rain-fed agriculture with a single
 agricultural season.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We selected farmers that produce maize, groundnuts and/or soybean.
 Maize is planted early in the year and harvest usually starts in April
 and proceeds through May.
 Soybean is harvested somewhat earlier, groundnuts somewhat later.
 Soybean and groundnuts can be sold pretty much immediately after the harvest;
 maize needs to be dried first.

To get a nationally representative sampling frame of the smallholder farmer
 population in Malawi, we rely on the list created by the Ministry of Agricultur
e for their Agricultural Input Programme (AIP).
 The AIP targets smallholder farmers in the villages who mostly registered
 with the village chiefs.
 We used a two-stage sampling procedure where we first sampled villages
 with the likelihood of a village being selected proportionate to the number
 of people that live in this village (such that larger villages are more
 likely to end up in the sample).
 We then randomly sampled 31 households in each of the sampled villages.

\begin_layout Standard
The focus of the study is on market participation and so the targeted study
 population consists of farmers that are likely to engage with markets.
 As such, we included qualifier questions in our survey, where we asked
 farmers if they were planning to sell maize, soybean or groundnuts during
 the 2022 and 2023 season.
 Restricting our study population to a particular sub-population has implication
s for the interpretation of the results.
 For instance, we will see later that we find relatively high proportions
 of households reporting to sell to the market.
 As such, the particular nature of the study population, semi-subsistence
 smallholder farmers, needs to be kept in mind when interpreting results,
 as they may be different from for example predominantly self-sufficient
 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data was collected in April 2022.
 At that time, treatments were also administered (using the simple design
 consisting of a control group and two treatment groups).
 A first round of follow-up data collection happened in September 2022,
 collecting detailed data on transactions between the start of the project
 and the time of the survey.
 A second follow-up survey was organized in January 2023 and asked about
 transactions between September 2022 and January 2023.
 These two follow-up surveys were phone based.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers were visited in person in April 2023 to inquire about transactions
 between January 2023 and April 2023.
 At that time, the treatment was repeated according to the new design consisting
 of seven treatment groups.
 Similar to the first season, we organized phone based surveys in September
 2023 and January 2024.
 The last survey in April 2024 was also phone based as we did not repeat
 the treatment but only collect data on transactions between January 2024
 and April 2024.

Table

\end_inset

 presents a number of summary statistics of sampled households and their
 heads at baseline.
 Eighty percent of households are headed by men.
 The average household is headed by a 43 year old with six years of schooling
 (primary level).
 The typical household has five members, living in houses with three rooms.
 Four in every 10 households have their main houses roofed with corrugated
 iron sheets (as opposed to thatch roofing).
 We find that the average distance of the households to the nearest all
 weather road and nearest market is 1.3 and 4.1 km respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected information on access to transport facilities or assets
 (either through ownership or hire).
 Results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Household-characteristics"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 show that households mostly have access to a bicycle (72% of respondents)
 and ox-carts (60% of the respondents).
 Ox-carts are particularly important for transportation of harvest from
 the farms to the market.
 We also collected information on livestock asset ownership, as these are
 often a form of savings that can be used as a buffer stock to smooth consumptio
n.

Other household characteristics that affect market participation included
 access to credit, access to storage, membership of cooperatives, and whether
 farmers had already promised part of the 2022 harvest to a buyer.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that among the surveyed farmers, about 40 percent indicate that they
 have access to credit, and that less than a quarter had outstanding debts
 averaging MK 57,000 to repay after harvest.
 With regards to access to storage, 60 percent of the households reported
 that they have access, of which half indicated that the storage was crop
 specific.
 We also find that, while farmer participation in cooperatives is limited,
 a moderate share (40%) have access to storage space provided by the cooperative.
 Lastly, we look at the proportion of farmers that commit a part of their
 crop to buyers before harvest—a scenario that may often lead farmers to
 sell at unfavorable prices, or reduces the amount of harvest that farmers
 can sell after harvest.
 We find that only a negligible share of farmers (8%) had already promised
 (part of) the 2022 crop to buyers prior to harvest.

We find significant imbalance on some of the variables, particularly for
 the sales plan treatment (T2).
 While joint F-test for separate treatment control comparisons are not significa

 from a multinomial model where the left hand side has three levels (T1,
 T2, Ctrl).

Primary outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the most parsimonious specification by reporting simple difference
s between treatment and control farmers obtained from an Ordinary Least
 Squares regression that regresses the outcome of interest on two dummy
 variables indicating if the household received T1 or T2 respectively.
 Results are in the top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Primary-maize"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Primary-maize"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we show results after including additional controls.
 These include the outcome at baseline, and village fixed effects.
 We start with Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Primary-maize"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, which reports results for maize; Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Primary-gnuts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

 are similar tables but for groundnuts and soybean, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first primary outcome we consider is stocks held of the commodity at the
 time of the midline survey.
 In particular, we asked farmers how many bags of the commodity (standard
 50 kg bags) they have in store.
 As the distributions are skewed to the right and includes zeros as well,
 we use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12325"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For both treatments, we expect a positive effect.
 Similar to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "augenblick2021budget"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we expect that when making households aware about future needs, they will
 reduce discretionary expenditures and save more for the future.
 Furthermore, if farmers expect prices to go up over time and this is reflected
 in their sales plan, farmers that are encouraged to commit to this sales
 plan will also be more likely to have saved more early on in the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the average control farmer has about 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_1[1,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 bags of maize in store at the time of the survey.
 We do not find that this is significantly different in the sample of farmers
 that were taken through a budgeting exercise.
 However, we do find that stocks are significantly higher among farmers
 that made a sales plan.
 Farmers that were asked to commit to a sales plan have stocks that are
 about 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_1[1,7]*100}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent higher than maize stocks of farmers in the control group.
 If we add village fixed effects, the effect becomes even stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second primary outcome tests if the household sold any of the crop in
 the interval between the intervention and this midline survey.
 For similar reasons why we expect stocks to be higher, we expect that the
 treatment would reduce the likelihood of selling early on in the season.
 We find that 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_1[3,1]*100}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 percent of households in the control group indicated that they made at
 least one sales transaction between in the first few months after the start
 of the project.
 We do not find that this proportion differs for farmers in T1 nor for farmers
 in T2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third primary outcome is related to the second and is the quantity that
 was sold during the period between the intervention and the first midline
 survey.
 While we may not find that the treatment reduced the fact that farmers
 sell early, we may still find that farmers sell less of the crop immediately
 after harvest.
 We find that farmers in the control group sell on average 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_1[4,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 bags of maize.
 Contrary to our expectations, we see that these quantities are higher in
 both treatment groups, but the differences are not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For farmers that did engage in sales, we can calculate the average price
 that farmers received for their crop.
 The aim of the intervention is to increase the price at which farmers sell.
 The farmers that sold in the control group got on average 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
Sexpr{prim_maize_1[6,1]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 MKW per kilogram of maize.
 We again do not find that prices differ significantly in any of the treatment
 groups.
 However, we expect that effects of the intervention will only become apparent
 at endline and prices over the entire period are taken into consideration.
 This is because the price effect is expected to come from more people selling
 later in the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also consider behaviour related to purchases of the commodities as key
 primary outcomes.
 We expect that, especially later in the season, due to our interventions
 households will have to buy back less.
 We see that in the control group, about 30 percent also made at least one
 purchase of maize before September midline data collection and this proportion
 is similar in both treatment groups.
 As for sales, we also look at quantities bought and prices at which the
 commodities were bought.
 We find that for maize, the average control group household bought less
 than one bag on average and paid slightly more than the sales price.
 We do not see any effects from the interventions.
