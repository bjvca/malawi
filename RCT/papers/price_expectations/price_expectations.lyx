\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in developing countries generally produce for own consumptio
n.
 However, most farmers also need cash for a variety of non-food expenditures.
 Some farmers therefore produce more than what they expect they will need
 and sell a surplus.
 Other farmers cultivate cash crops.
 Therefore, most farmers are not strictly subsistence farmers, but also
 participate in the market, not only as consumers, but also as producers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When farmers interact with markets, they are also exposed to price risk.
 In weakly integrated markets where spatial arbitrage is slow and transaction
 costs to move commodities from low price regions to high price areas are
 high, prices often exhibit significant variation both in time and space
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "van2007modelling"

\end_inset

.
 This generally also means that prices exhibit significant seasonality,
 with price at their lowest immediately after harvest as supply booms, and
 then gradually increasing until reaching a peak just before the next harvest

\begin_layout Standard
These predictable and recurrent price movements suggests that farmers have
 an incentive to delay sales of at least part of their marketable surplus
 until prices recover.
 In practice, however, we often see that farmers sell all of their crop
 immediately after harvest when prices are at their lowest.
 Often, later in the season, farmers run out of stocks and are forced to
 turn to the market again, now buying the same commodity at much higher
 prices.
 This has sometimes been referred to as that

\begin_layout Standard
Various reasons have been suggested to explain this behaviour.
 The most obvious reason would be that farmers simply need the money.

 uses the fact that in Malawi, primary school began 3 months earlier in
 2010 than in 2009, and notes that this prompted households with children
 to sell maize when prices are particularly low.

 offered subsidized loans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia
 and conclude that liquidity constraints contribute to inequality in rural
 economies.
 Farmers may simply lack sufficient safe storage space for their crops,
 making it too expensive to store for longer periods of time.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, the focus is on the price.
 From the time of harvest onward, farmers need to engage in complex inter-tempor
al cost-benefit calculations and compare what they could get now to what
 they expect they could get in the future.
 The key unknown in this Euler equation is the price of the commodity in
 the future.
 The farmer will have to, with the best possible information he has at the
 time of decision making, form expectations about the price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If farmers sell too low, it means that they expect the price in the future
 to be too low.
 There are many reasons why farmers estimate the price to be too low.
 Due to anchoring, farmers ma
\end_layout

In this paper, we use survey data to investigate price expectations.
 In particular, we asked farmers at the time of the harvest about their
 price expectations at two points in time in the near future.

 shows price expectations for the three crops included in the study (expressed
 per kg of the crop).
 As can be seen, farmers expect that prices increase over time.
 But, at least for maize and groundnuts, uncertainty about expected prices
 also seem to increase over time.
 The increase of the expected price over the course of only a few months
 is substantial.
 For example, for maize, the increase in median price is
