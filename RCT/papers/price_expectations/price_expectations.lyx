Inertia in price expectations: The case of smallholder farmers in Malawi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in low and middle income countries often sell the bulk
 of their marketable surplus immediately after the harvest, when prices
 are at their lowest.

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in developing countries generally produce for own consumptio
n.
 However, most farmers also need cash for a variety of non-food expenditures.
 Some farmers therefore produce more than what they expect they will need
 and sell a surplus.
 Other farmers cultivate cash crops.
 Therefore, most farmers are not strictly subsistence farmers, but also
 participate in the market, not only as consumers, but also as producers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When farmers interact with markets, they are also exposed to price risk.
 In weakly integrated markets where spatial arbitrage is slow and transaction
 costs to move commodities from low price regions to high price areas are
 high, prices often exhibit significant variation both in time and space

\end_inset

.
 This generally also means that prices exhibit significant seasonality,
 with price at their lowest immediately after harvest as supply booms, and
 prices then gradually increasing until reaching a peak just before the
 next harvest

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These predictable and recurrent price movements suggests that farmers have
 an incentive to delay sales of at least part of their marketable surplus
 until prices recover from their post harvest slump.
 In practice, however, we often see that farmers sell all of their crop
 immediately after harvest when prices are at their lowest.
 Often, later in the season, farmers run out of stocks and are forced to
 turn to the market again, now buying back the same commodities at much
 higher prices.
 This has sometimes been referred to as the

 phenomenon

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various reasons have been suggested to explain this behaviour.
 The most obvious reason would be that farmers simply need the money.
 For instance

 report on a field experiment in Kenya and suggest that credit market imperfecti
ons limit farmersâ€™ abilities to move grain intertemporally.

 uses the fact that in Malawi, primary school began 3 months earlier in
 2010 than in 2009, and notes that this prompted households with children
 to sell maize when prices are particularly low.
 To identify the impacts of liquidity during the lean season,

 offered subsidized loans in randomly selected villages in rural Zambia
 and conclude that liquidity constraints contribute to inequality in rural
 economies.
 Another often heard reason is that farmers may simply lack sufficient safe
 storage space for their crops, making it too expensive to store for longer
 periods of time.
 If storage is the main reason why farmers do not engage in intertemporal
 arbitrage, then providing storage technology should delay sales.

 indeed find that Ugandan maize farmers that received a low cost, simple,
 and effective technology for low resource farmers to help them preserve
 their dry crops after harvest with minimal losses due to storage insects
 (so called PICS bags) stored maize for a longer period.
 However, in a study comparing the importance of liquidity constraints and
 storage limitations, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "CHANNA2022102851"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 finds that only the former contains farmers from selling later at higher
 prices in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above factors will be binding for some farmers, many questions
 remain unanswered.
 For example, if liquidity constraints are the main problem, it is unclear
 why farmers generally sell everything at once, instead of just enough to
 cover the most urgent expenses.
 If storage is a problem, it seems strange strange that not more farmers
 form groups to rent storage space, or why in Malawi the Agricultural Commodity
 Exchange faces difficulties filling their warehouses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, the focus is on the role of price expectations.
 From the time of harvest onward, farmers need to engage in complex inter-tempor
al cost-benefit calculations and compare what they could get now to what
 they expect they could get in the future.
 The key unknown in this Euler equation is the price of the commodity in
 the future.
 At the time of the harvest, the farmer needs to form expectations about
 the price conditional on the information set available, and this needs
 to be continuously updated as new information becomes available over time.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A recent working paper argues that the assumption that farmers sell too
 low may be false.
 Using price data from 751 markets in 26 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa,
 they find that seasonal price movements are limited and the probability
 of negative returns to storage substantial

.
 However, it remains unclear if the prices that these authors use (collected
 in market centers) are representative of the prices farmer face.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One reason why farmers may consistently underestimate future prices is
 related to inertia or anchoring, where farmers rely on past experience
 to predict future prices..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we use survey data to investigate price expectations.
 In particular, we asked farmers at the time of the harvest about their
 price expectations at two points in time in the near future.
 We then look at smallholder market participation in the season preceding
 the survey with a particular focus on prices received.
 We then correlate prices received in the past to price expectations in
 the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that prices farmers that received higher prices in the previous
 season also expect higher prices in the next season.
 This is especially the case for groundnuts; for soybean, prices in the
 past are not correlated to prices in the future.
 Furthermore, we find that farmers that experienced a larger increase in
 prices over the previous season also expect prices to rise faster.
 This is especially the case if farmers experienced a price increase early
 in the season.

 As can be seen, farmers expect that prices increase over time.

 is substantial.

Anchoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now investigate the relationship between price expectations and prices
 received in the past.
 We first relate the average price that the farmer received in the previous
 season to price expectations in the next season using OLS models.
 To enable comparisons across crops, we use natural logarithms of both expected
 prices and prices received in the past, such that results can be interpreted
 as elasticities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Correlation-with-average"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 starts by correlating overall price expectations (defined as simple average
 over expected price in September and December) to the average price that
 the farmer reported to have received over the preceding season.
 We see that there is a significant correlation between prices received
 in the past and price expectations for maize and for groundnuts, but not
 for soybean.
 For example the first column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Correlation-with-average"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that farmers that sold at double the price (100 percent) than other
 farmers report expected prices that are about 10 percent higher than what
 other farmers expect.
 The second column shows that the elasticity is almost double for groundnuts.
 We do not find that price expectations for soybean are significantly correlated
 with average price expectations in the next season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table also shows correlation at prices at particular points in time
 in the future (instead of simple averages).
 For maize, the relationship between past prices and expected prices seems
 stable over time: farmers that received higher prices in the past expect
 higher prices in both September and December and the elasticity is the
 same.
 For groundnuts, a change in the average price received in the previous
 season is correlated to a larger price increase in the expected price in
 September than in December.
 The independence of price expectations and past prices of soybean is confirmed.

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of simply averaging prices received in the previous season, we can
 also look at price dynamics in the previous season to better understand
 the formation of expectations.
 For instance, we can check if expectations of the price evolution in the
 next season of farmers that experienced a sharp increase in prices they
 received for their crops in the previous season differ from expectations
 of farmers that experienced relatively stable prices throughout the previous
 season.
 To answer this question, we can exploit the fact that some farmers sold
 more than once in the previous season and relate changes in past prices
 to changes in expected future prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each transaction in the previous season, we recorded price obtained
 and the month in which the transaction took place.
 To facilitate analysis, we categorize transactions into three periods.
 First, transactions in May, June or July 2021 are categorizes as early
 sales.
 Transactions in August, September and October are referred to as average
 sales.
 And finally, sales made in November, December and January are grouped into
 the third category and are referred to as late sales.
 We calculate average prices obtained during transactions within each of
 these three periods at the farmer level and then estimate the following
 first-differences models:

.
 In the first column, we pool all crops, while the remaining three columns
 provide results for separate regressions for each crop.
 In the first row, the change in prices received is based on average prices
 in August, September and October and average prices received in November,
 December and January.
 This roughly corresponds to the difference in timing used for the dependent
 variables (change between September and December).The second row uses the
 same dependent variable but relates it to prices received early in the
 season of 2021 and prices received late in the season.
 The last row relates changes in expected prices to changes between prices
 early in the season and mid season.

Alternative explanations for price expectations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected harvest of a particular crop may also affect prices farmers
 expect.
 Indeed, recent evidence suggests that even before the harvest materialized,
 traders respond to weather shocks by increasing prices, indicating that
 the expectation channel accounts for a substantial share of supply side
 food price shocks

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that prices farmers that received higher prices in the previous
 season also expect higher prices in the next season.
 This is especially the case for groundnuts; for soybean, prices in the
 past are not correlated to prices in the future.
 Furthermore, we find that farmers that experienced a larger increase in
 prices over the previous season also expect prices to rise faster.
 This is especially the case if farmers experienced a price increase early
 in the season.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that prices received in the past are positively correlated to price
 expectations.
 If farmers are myopic about inflation, this will mean price expectations
 are biased downward.
 With average inflation at around 16 percent, it is likely that farmers
 prone to anchoring leave substantial amounts of money on the table.
